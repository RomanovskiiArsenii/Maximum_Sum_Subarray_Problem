# Maximum_Sum_Subarray_Problem

The maximum sum subarray problem involves finding the highest sum of a continuous subsequence within an array or list of integers:
maxSequence [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]  should be 6:  [4, -1, 2, 1]

The maximum subarray sum problem can be effectively solved using Kadane's algorithm.
